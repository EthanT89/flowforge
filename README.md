# FlowForge

A modern automation platform designed to surpass existing solutions like Make.com and Zapier with superior AI integration, intuitive workflow design, and performance-focused architecture.

## Overview

FlowForge is a visual automation platform built around a sophisticated workflow execution engine. The platform treats AI as a first-class citizen rather than an afterthought, enabling intelligent data processing, content personalization, and workflow optimization.

The initial use case focuses on automated entrepreneur outreach - identifying tech innovators, gathering contact information, and sending personalized communications. However, the platform is architected for extensibility across various automation scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Visual Workflow Designer** - Drag-and-drop interface for building complex automation workflows
- **AI-Native Architecture** - Integrated AI processing for content generation and data analysis
- **High Performance** - Sub-200ms API response times with support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Modern Integrations** - Built for contemporary APIs and services
- **Scalable Execution** - Parallel processing with intelligent error handling and retry logic

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python 3.11+) - High-performance async web framework
- **PostgreSQL 15+** - Primary data storage
- **Redis 7+** - Caching and session management
- **Celery** - Background job processing
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+** - ORM with Alembic migrations
- **Pydantic v2** - Data validation and serialization
- **httpx** - Async HTTP client

### Frontend
- **React 18+** with TypeScript
- **React Flow** - Drag-and-drop workflow interface
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Vite** - Build tooling

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **AWS** - Cloud infrastructure (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline
- **Prometheus + Grafana** - Monitoring and metrics

## Architecture

### Workflow Engine
The core execution engine processes directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of interconnected nodes with:
- Parallel execution of independent branches
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Resource management and performance monitoring
- Real-time execution status tracking

### Node System
Plugin-based architecture supporting various node types:
- **HTTP Request** - API calls with authentication handling
- **Data Transform** - Data processing and manipulation
- **AI Processing** - GPT integration for content generation
- **Conditional Logic** - Workflow branching and decision making
- **Triggers** - Schedule and webhook-based workflow initiation

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup** (In Progress)
- [x] Project architecture and planning
- [ ] FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Database schema implementation
- [ ] Core workflow CRUD operations
- [ ] Job queue system setup
- [ ] Basic node type implementations

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Backend foundation and core architecture
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Workflow execution engine
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): API integrations and core node types
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 13-18): React frontend and visual designer
- **Phase 5** (Weeks 19-22): Entrepreneur outreach use case implementation
- **Phase 6** (Weeks 23-26): Production deployment and optimization

## Use Case: Entrepreneur Outreach

Initial workflow implementation includes:

1. **Target Identification** - LinkedIn/Twitter scraping, tech publication monitoring
2. **Data Enrichment** - Contact discovery via Hunter.io, Clearbit, background research
3. **AI Personalization** - Tailored message generation based on profile analysis
4. **Multi-channel Outreach** - Email, LinkedIn, Twitter delivery with timing optimization
5. **Response Tracking** - Engagement monitoring and automated follow-up sequences

## Performance Targets

- API Response Time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- Concurrent Users: 1,000+
- Workflow Throughput: 10,000+ executions/hour
- System Uptime: 99.9%
- Workflow Success Rate: >95%

## Getting Started

*Setup instructions will be available once the FastAPI foundation is complete.*

```bash
# Development setup (coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/username/flowforge.git
