# FlowForge Backend

The core API and workflow execution engine for the FlowForge automation platform.

## Purpose

This backend service provides the foundational infrastructure for FlowForge, handling workflow management, execution, data processing, and external service integrations. It serves as the central nervous system that powers the visual workflow designer and automation capabilities.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Workflow Management** - CRUD operations for workflows, nodes, and connections
- **Execution Engine** - Process workflows as directed acyclic graphs with parallel execution
- **Job Queue System** - Background task processing for long-running operations
- **API Integrations** - Connectors for external services and data sources
- **Authentication & Authorization** - User management and access control
- **Data Processing** - Transformation, validation, and persistence of workflow data
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections for live workflow status

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **FastAPI** - High-performance async web framework with automatic API documentation
- **Python 3.11+** - Modern Python with improved performance and type hints
- **Pydantic v2** - Data validation and serialization with enhanced performance
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server for production deployment

### Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL 15+** - Primary relational database for structured data
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+** - Modern ORM with async support
- **Alembic** - Database migration management
- **Redis 7+** - Caching, session storage, and job queue backend

### Background Processing
- **Celery** - Distributed task queue for workflow execution
- **Redis** - Message broker and result backend for Celery workers

### HTTP & External APIs
- **httpx** - Async HTTP client for external API integrations
- **OAuth libraries** - Authentication with third-party services
- **Rate limiting** - Intelligent request throttling for external APIs

### Development & Testing
- **pytest** - Testing framework with async support
- **Black** - Code formatting
- **flake8** - Linting and style checking
- **mypy** - Static type checking

## Architecture Goals

### Performance
- Sub-200ms API response times for standard operations
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Efficient workflow execution with minimal resource overhead
- Intelligent caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through stateless API design
- Background job processing with worker auto-scaling
- Database optimization for high-throughput operations
- Microservice-ready architecture for future expansion

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Workflow execution retry logic with exponential backoff
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- Graceful degradation under load

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting and request validation
- Secure handling of third-party API credentials
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## API Design Principles

- **RESTful endpoints** following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- **Async-first** architecture for optimal performance
- **Type-safe** request/response models with Pydantic
- **Comprehensive documentation** auto-generated from code
- **Versioned APIs** for backward compatibility
- **Consistent error responses** with detailed error codes

## Integration Capabilities

### Planned Connectors
- **Web Scraping** - BeautifulSoup, Scrapy for data extraction
- **Email Services** - SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun integration
- **AI Services** - OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude API integration
- **Social Media** - LinkedIn, Twitter API connectors
- **Data Enrichment** - Hunter.io, Clearbit, Apollo integrations
- **File Processing** - CSV, JSON, Excel data manipulation
- **Webhooks** - Inbound and outbound webhook handling

### Authentication Support
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party service authorization
- Custom authentication schemes for specialized integrations

## Development Status

Currently in **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
- Setting up FastAPI application structure
- Implementing core database models and migrations
- Building authentication and user management system
- Developing workflow CRUD operations
- Establishing job queue infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-tenancy** support for enterprise deployments
- **Plugin system** for custom node type development
- **Workflow templates** and marketplace integration
- **Advanced monitoring** with metrics and alerting
- **GraphQL API** for complex data querying
- **Workflow versioning** and rollback capabilities
